								<h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
								<p>We were inspired by Dr. Ziegelstein's lecture to focus on giving patients the best bang for their buck, especially as health care prices soar. Whenever pills are mixed or taken out of their container, identifying them can be a big problem; if you don't know which drugs a pill contains, you should never take it. Many people with this problem can simply use online pill identification software by inputting the imprint, colour, and other details about the pill, but this isn't always the case for elderly patients or others with poor eyesight who may not be able to read the imprint clearly, leading to drug misidentification. This disadvantages those in this position and increases the practical cost of their healthcare through wasted drugs.</p>
